# Pyhton-SQL
A Phython+SQL project 

In this project, I utilized Python and SQL within a Jupyter Notebook to analyze eCommerce sales data. I executed SQL queries to extract and manage datasets, focusing on sales trends and customer behavior. Using Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib, I visualized key insights into product performance and seasonal sales fluctuations. The analysis provided actionable recommendations to enhance sales strategies. This project highlights my skills in data analysis, database management, and data visualization.
